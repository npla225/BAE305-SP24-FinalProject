## Summary of Project ##

For the BAE 305 final project, our group created a drink mixer, specifically an Arnold Palmer mixer. An Arnold Palmer is a mixed drink consisting of iced tea and lemonade, with our machine dispensing 25% lemonade and 75% iced tea. Pressing a certain color button (green, yellow, red) on the Arduino, will start the code and open the solenoids in the mixer causing tea and lemonade to be dispensed into a cup. The amount of Arnold Palmer depends on the button pressed with the green dispensing 4 ounces, the yellow dispensing 8 ounces, and the red dispensing 12 ounces. Once the amount of Arnold Palmer is properly dispensed, a stirrer attached to a motor will rotate within the cup causing the drink to be mixed. After a small delay once the stirrer stops, another button can be pressed again to start the code again with a different proportion amount. The iced tea and the lemonade were stored in a 2-liter plastic bottle held a few feet above the cup to allow natural flow caused by gravity. Once a button is pressed, a double relay switch is turned on and a solenoid on each side of the machine will activate and allow the liquid to flow through causing the cup to be filled. Lastly, an LCD was used to instruct the user on how to use the mixer and as well as display congratulations once the process is over.
