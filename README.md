## Summary of Project ##

For the project, our group created a drink mixer, specifically an Arnold Palmer mixer. An Arnold Palmer is a mixed drink consisting of iced tea and lemonade, with our machine dispensing 25% lemonade and 75% iced tea. Pressing a certain color button (green, yellow, red) on the Arduino, will start the code and open the solenoids in the mixer causing tea and lemonade to be dispensed into a cup. The amount of Arnold Palmer depends on the button pressed with the green dispensing 6 ounces, the yellow dispensing 12 ounces, and the red dispensing 24 ounces. Once the amount of Arnold Palmer is properly dispensed, a stirrer attached to a motor will rotate within the cup causing the drink to be mixed. A
